# Add Favicon To Your Publish Website

Favicon is an important icon for your website tab. With a favicon, your website is easy to recognize.

To add a favicon, you should add your favicon image to your `Resources` folder.

> I highly recommended your favicon dimensions is 16x16 pixel.

Step:
1. For more organized project folders, add new folder which is `Images` folder inside the `Resources` folder.

```
Resources
        Images
```

2. Add your favicon images inside the `Images` folder.

```
Resources
        Images
                favicon.png
```
3. The final step, add the following code in the `main.swift` file.

```
struct SampleWebsite: Website {
    ...
    var favicon: Favicon? { .init(path: "Images/favicon.png", type: "image/png") }
}
```
