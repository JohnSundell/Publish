# Add Images To Your Publish Website

Sometimes we want adding images to our website for make our article clear.

Here are the steps to adding images.

Step:

1. Adding images in `Resources` folder.
2. To more organized, add new folder with the name `Images` and also add new folder with the title of the articel that we want to upload image there. For example, we have new article with title "Example-Article". Our folder hierarchy should like this:
```
Resources
		Images
			Example-Article
					image.png						
```
3. In our `Content` | `post`, add a new file for writing the article. So, create `example-article.md` file as we mention before that we have a new article with that title. Our folder hierarchy should like this:
```
Content
		post
			example-article.md			
```

4. Finally, in `example-article.md`	file, add a markdown syntax like this:
```
![ImageAlt](/Images/Example-Article/image.png)
```
